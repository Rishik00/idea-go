## Oh, hello there. 

Aren't you sweet trying to visit my cute little repo's documentation here. Let's get you up and running. If you want the executable you can find it here: Link. 

But I recommend building it yourself, its really simple as long as you have the following: 

1. go version > 1.18
2. A text editor (if you dont, I cant help you)

A few things have already been set in stone for you, such as the name of the database because let's be honest here: neither of us is gonna care :). But you have full liberty to add your ideas and categorize them!

Alright, so here goes: 

1. Pull the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Rishik00/idea-go.git`
2. Build all the packages using `go mod tidy`
3. Run `go build -o idea`
4. Try running the CLI once you have a built executable using the command: `idea`
5. Do the setup using `idea setupdb` (Yet to be implemented)
6. And you're done! The CLI has very few commands so as long as you setup everything correctly, you should have no problem syncing ideas between local to notion :)
