# idea
A very simple idea log that can sync up with notion. Built using golang. 

## Why does this exist? 
I get a crap ton of ideas every week, and I dont have the energy (and RAM - its notion we're talking about) to keep a billion notion tabs open. I also love the command line and wanted to build a CLI, so it really was a perfect blend of things to give me what I need. 

It's a very basic and simple project, and I really intended for it to be as simple as possible for other poeple to use it or work with it (if you're insane enough).
